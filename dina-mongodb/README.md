# Dina MongoDB Module

## Overview
The `dina-mongodb` module provides the integration layer for interactions with the MongoDB database. It abstracts low-level driver calls and facilitates object mapping for document-oriented data.

## Technologies
*   **Driver**: Mongo Java Driver 2.12.2
*   **Object Mapping**: Jongo 1.0 (with Jackson BSON support)
*   **Utilities**: Apache Commons Lang 2.6

## Purpose
This module is used for storing unstructured or semi-structured data that fits better in a document store than a relational database, supporting specific features of the loan application.
